# Non-symbolic numeric comparison

Here stores the scripts used to generate stimuli used in a mathematical test named "Non-symbolic numberic comparison.

Basic configurations are based on [Libertus, et. al.](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01080.x)(2011).

## Number ratio selection

Four ratios are selected, which are `1:2`, `2:3`, `3:4`, `6:7` respectively. At the same time, the count of dots range from 6 to 14. Thus for each case of ratio, the count of dots are:

* `1:2` -> `6:12`, `7:14`
* `2:3` -> `6:9`, `8:12`
* `3:4` -> `6:8`, `9:12`
* `6:7` -> `6:7`, `12:14`

Each case of combinations consists of ten trials in test phase.
